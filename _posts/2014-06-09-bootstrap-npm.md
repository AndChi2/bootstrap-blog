title: Bootstrap now available via npm
---

It's taken us awhile, but we've finally [published Bootstrap](https://npmjs.org/packages/bootstrap) to the <npmjs.org> registry. We've taken over the existing `bootstrap` package and just published the latest release, v3.1.1. The package is managed by the [twbs user](https://npmjs.org/~twbs), just like on GitHub. In the future, when we release new versions of Bootstrap, we'll update npm as well.

And on that note, you can expect v3.2.0 to be released sometime later this month. Woohoo!
