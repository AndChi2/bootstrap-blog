Bootstrap 3.3.7 is here! We've had over 220 commits and 80 closed issues and pull requests from nearly 30 contributors since our last release. Woohoo!

Here are some of the highlights:

- Added support for jQuery 3.
- Added inline source files into sourcemap eliminating `4xx` errors on the CDN.
- Updated several devDependencies and gems.
- Removed unsupported vendor prefixes for `@viewport`.
