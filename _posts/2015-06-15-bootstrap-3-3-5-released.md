Bootstrap 3.3.5 is here! This release has been focused on bug fixes, accessibility improvements, and documentation updates. We've had over 330 commits and 160 closed issues and pull requests from over 40 contributors since our last release! Hell yeah.

Here are some of the highlights:

- Updated to Normalize.css v3.0.3.
- List groups now support `<button>` elements.
- Cleaned up some extraneous `padding` on jumbotrons across various viewports.
- Fixed input group sizing classes on all supported elements for real this time.
- Applied a few tooltip and popover positioning fixes.
- Fixed behavior when using tooltips and popovers that are triggered by multiple events.
- Fixed some memory leakage in the tooltip and popover plugins.
- Fixed incorrect Affix positioning when a webpage has a sticky footer.
- Fixed npm package to include all Grunt scripts, so that `grunt dist` works if you installed Bootstrap from npm.
