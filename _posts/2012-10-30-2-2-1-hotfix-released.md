title: 2.2.1 hotfix released
---

After the [2.2.0 release last night](/2012/10/29/bootstrap-2-2-0-released/), we found one major bug that we wanted to fix right away. Tonight, [@fat](http://twitter.com/fat) just pushed a fix for the carousel bug with a quick 2.2.1 release. Upgrading should be super simple given the scope of this release. You can [download 2.2.1 directly](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/zipball/master) here.

Once more, apologies for any hiccups. Happy Bootstrapping!

Thanks!
